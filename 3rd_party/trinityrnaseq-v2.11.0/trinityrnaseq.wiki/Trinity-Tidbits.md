#Trinity Tidbits

- Trinity made the cover of the [July 2011 NBT issue](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v29/n7/index.html). The Broad Institute's [blog](http://www.broadinstitute.org/blog/suite-tools-takes-flight) has a story on how the Trinity project came together. Nir Friedman, one of the project PIs, has a [blog entry](http://nirfriedmanlab.blogspot.com/2011/07/behind-cover.html) describing the developmental process underlying the NBT cover design.

- Trinity was shown to be the leading de novo transcriptome assembly tool as part of the [DREAM6 Alt-Splicing Challenge 2011](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2817724/wiki/70953). Results were posted [here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2817724/wiki/70955).  

- [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=14735674943942667509) shows how Trinity is being used by the community.
