** Installing Inchworm **

Hopefully, all you should need to do is this:

    make

    
and 'inchworm' will appear as ./bin/inchworm


** Running Inchworm **

Inchworm will assemble RNA-Seq data from a fasta-formatted data set.  Inchworm builds a debruijn graph and traversed the graph to report sequence assemblies.

By default, inchworm expects that the data are strand-specific and sense-oriented.

Run like so:

      inchworm --reads $fasta_file  --run_inchworm  > assemblies.SS.fasta


If you do not have strand-specific data, run in double-stranded mode:

     inchworm --reads $fasta_file --run_inchworm --DS > assemblies.DS.fasta


A useful option to include is:  --monitor 1 
which will report the status of parsing the reads while building the kmer graph.


There is no 'paired read' mode currently in inchworm.  It treats each read independently. If you have pairs, just include them all in a single fasta file with the sequences properly oriented for strand-specificity (sense strand).


The assembly sequences output by inchworm are formatted like so:

>a1;123

a1 corresponds to 'assembly 1', and 123 corresponds to an average kmer coverage (ie. read coverage) for the assembly.


By default, a Kmer value of 25 is used.  You can change this with the option -K
