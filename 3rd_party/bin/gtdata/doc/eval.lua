The program shows sensitivity and specificity values for certain feature types
(e.g., gene, mRNA, and exon). For some feature types the number of missing and
wrong features of that type is also shown. Thereby, ``missing'' means the number
of features of that type from the ``reference'' without overlap to a feature of
that type from the ``prediction''. Vice versa, ``wrong'' denotes the number of
features of that type from the ``prediction'' without overlap to a feature of
that type from the ``reference''.]])
