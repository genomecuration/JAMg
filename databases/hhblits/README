One could download and use the latest UniRef/UniProt database from 
ftp://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/pub/HH-suite/databases/hhsuite_dbs

but then you will want to remove the hypothetical and transposons from it.
See get_seqs_from_ffindex_index.pl in util directory

Alternatively, you can use the databases I created.
They are available from here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/jamg/files/databases/

They have been produced using refseq and kclust. 
In the case of fungi, hypotheticals are left in because they constituted 
half the database (seems most fungal data are hypothetical!)

If you multiple CPUs, I recommend you install and use parallel bzip2 (pbzip2). Eg.
pbzip2 -kdvl [yourdatabase].tar.bz2
or pbzip2 -kdvp[number of cpus] [yourdatabase].tar.bz2
tar -xf [yourdatabase].tar
rm -f [yourdatabase].tar
